 * A key continued by one solid stays; continued by several, each is `key/split(q)`, q by the rank of the first face it keeps, then the
 * solids keeping none. Fresh keys are `feature/split(k)`: solids continuing the tool by rank, merges by rank, then solids keeping no face.
 * Ranks order only solids whose first faces lie in the same solid of a source: solids ordered by faces of different solids of one source,
 * as a whole body's several solids are, or by the kernel's order, are ambiguous when there are two or more of them, never ordered by where
 * they lie. A piece no solid continues or merges is lost, unless pieces can't be identified.
 *
 * Ambiguity carries in groups: the keys that descend from one group through one source form a group, so the copies of one pattern
 * occurrence are never confused with another's. A group's earlier pieces that no solid continues stay in it, as keys that can't be found,
 * while any solid descends from the group through the target, and are lost once none does.
