# TODO - Wire EDM G-Code Viewer

## Notes
- Review this file weekly to update priorities and status
- Add time estimates to help with sprint planning
- Completed Tasks, should be moved under Completed tasks section. Respecting the summarization convention. Brief and concice, like the others.
- Completed Tasks section begins near line 69. Items are listed newest-to-oldest (top to bottom): latest completions are at the top, oldest at the bottom. Read the header/notes first; avoid scanning the entire file unless needed.

## Active Tasks

### üî¥ Critical Priority

Bug - Contine on current branch. the set new start behavior does not work well with G2/G3 files. Also, we need to create some clear separation between the "header"/start(config) commands, and the gcode body. Right now when setting new point, the header also gets moved.( i think it might be the parsing too, it doesnt clearly identify where the header stops. idk , needs further investigation). But, my point, is that we need to set up the gcode drawer folders or subfolders. and have the header clearly placed in one of them at the top. And than the body get split into folders for each closed contour there is, for better UX and management.

### üü° High Priority

<!-- none currently -->

### üü¢ Medium Priority


- [POLISH] Mouse Wheel Zoom behavior ‚è≥
  - Priority: üü¢ Medium
   - Estimate: M
  - Files: `src/core/MouseEventHandler.js`, `src/core/Viewport.js`
  - Description: Zoom is centered on screen as intended; refine acceleration, min/max clamp feel, and smoothing. Consider animated zoom or easing.
  - Acceptance: Smooth, predictable zoom steps; clamped ranges feel natural; no jitter.

### üîµ Low Priority


## Refactoring & Technical Debt

### [REFACTOR] Remove Global App Access Pattern ‚úÖ
**Priority**: üü° High  
**Category**: [REFACTOR]  
**Estimate**: M  
**File**: `src/components/GCodeDrawer.js`

**Resolution**:
- Implemented event-driven retrieval of clicked points in `GCodeDrawer`.
- Added/used event types: `point:get:clicked` ‚Üí `point:clicked:response`.
- Wired response in `src/core/EventWiring.js` to return a copy of `app.clickedPoints`.

**Notes**:
- Legacy global `window.wireEDMViewer` remains for backward compatibility, but `GCodeDrawer` no longer relies on it.
- Follow-up tracked above: remove Toolbar‚Äôs remaining global usage for normalization text.

## Completed Tasks
*Tasks should always be placed at the top of the list (as the list grows, enables us to find the latest, without scrolling or reading the whole file)*
### ‚úÖ Done
- [UI] Button visual feedback improvements ‚Äî Enhanced hover/pressed/focus states with theme tokens; removed translateY animation 
  - Commit (6a1a553)
- [REFACTOR] Remove Toolbar Global Access ‚Äî Completed
  - Resolution: Inject `gcodeDrawer` into `Toolbar` (no `window.wireEDMViewer`); normalization reads drawer text, falls back to loaded file.
  - Files: `src/components/Toolbar.js`, `src/core/ComponentInitializer.js`
- Arc rendering fixes and G2/G3 coordinate normalization; Debug overlay system for arc geometry visualization; Parser improvements for IJ-absolute/relative modes
- [BUG] Duplicate point delete emission ‚Äî Fixed
  - Resolution: Removed Sidebar direct `.delete-point-btn` listeners and rely on global `EventDelegator` capture for a single `POINT_DELETE` emission.
  - Verified: Single click emits one `POINT_DELETE` and triggers one `POINT_UPDATE` cascade.
  - Files: `src/components/Sidebar.js`, `src/core/EventDelegator.js`, `src/core/EventWiring.js`
- [REFACTOR] Remove Global App Access Pattern ‚Äî Completed
  - Resolution: `GCodeDrawer` now requests clicked points via events; `EventWiring` responds with `POINT_CLICKED_RESPONSE`.
  - Files: `src/components/GCodeDrawer.js`, `src/core/events/EventTypes.js`, `src/core/EventWiring.js`
- [BUG] Text Rendering System ‚Äî Fixed coordinate mismatch for grid labels and point markers
  - Resolution: Adopted Strategy A (screen-space text with `viewport.worldToScreen`); grid/marker labels now align perfectly at all zoom levels.
  - Files: `src/components/canvas/CanvasGrid.js`, `src/components/canvas/MarkerRenderer.js`, `src/utils/geometry/CoordinateTransforms.js`
- [FEATURE] Dynamic Grid System ‚Äî Implemented zoom-responsive grid density with adaptive spacing and infinite coordinate axes
  - Resolution: Added logarithmic grid spacing algorithms, pixel-density visibility thresholds, and viewport-bounded infinite axes. Label precision adapts to spacing (coarser ‚Üí fewer decimals).
  - Files: `src/utils/Constants.js`, `src/utils/geometry/CoordinateTransforms.js`, `src/components/canvas/CanvasGrid.js`
