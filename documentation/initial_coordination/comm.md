# Agent Communication Log

## Communication Protocol
Agents must follow this protocol for coordination:

1. **Before starting**: Log intent with timestamp
2. **During work**: Update progress every 30 minutes
3. **On completion**: Mark task complete in completed.md
4. **On blocking**: Log dependency wait
5. **On conflict**: Escalate for coordination review

## Entry Format
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Agent [ID] - [Status]
**Task**: [Current task description]
**Progress**: [What's been done]
**Next**: [What's coming next]  
**Blocks**: [Any dependencies/conflicts]
**ETA**: [Estimated completion]
---
```

## Status Types
- **STARTING** - Beginning work on task
- **WORKING** - Actively working on task
- **BLOCKED** - Waiting on dependency
- **TESTING** - Testing completed work
- **COMPLETE** - Task finished
