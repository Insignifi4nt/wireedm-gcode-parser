### 1. Project Structure (✅ Excellent)

```
src/
├── main.js                 # Application entry point
├── components/            # UI components
├── core/                 # Core functionality  
├── utils/                # Utilities and helpers
└── styles/               # CSS styling
```

The project follows a clean modular architecture with logical grouping of functionality.

### 2. Core Components Analysis

#### 2.1 G-Code Parser (`src/core/GCodeParser.js`) - ⭐ **Solid Implementation**

**Strengths:**
- Proper G-code command parsing (G0, G1, G2, G3)
- Motion code normalization (G01 → G1)
- Error handling with warnings and statistics
  - Bounds calculation for path visualization
- Support for I, J parameters in arc commands

**Issues:**
- Arc calculations appear correct in parser, but rendering has accuracy issues
- Limited validation of arc parameters (missing R-format support)
- No support for other G-codes beyond motion commands

#### 2.2 Canvas Rendering (`src/components/Canvas.js`) - ⭐ **Well Structured**

**Strengths:**
- High-DPI support architecture
- Screen-space consistent rendering
- Proper viewport transformations
- Point highlighting and selection system

**Critical Issues:**
- **Arc Rendering Problem**: The arc rendering logic in `_renderArcMove()` appears mathematically correct, but the user reports accuracy issues. The problem likely lies in:
  1. Canvas arc direction handling (`!move.clockwise` inversion)
  2. Coordinate system transformation affecting arc geometry
  3. Potential floating-point precision issues in arc calculations

**Recommendations for Arc Fix:**
```javascript
// In Canvas.js _renderArcMove method, consider:
1. Debug arc parameters before rendering
2. Validate start/end points match expected positions
3. Test with known arc G-codes to isolate the issue
4. Consider alternative arc rendering using path segments
```

#### 2.3 G-Code Drawer (`src/components/GCodeDrawer.js`) - ⭐ **Feature-Complete**

**Current Capabilities:**
- Line-by-line G-code display
- Hover highlighting with canvas sync
- Click selection with persistent highlighting  
- Content editing with debounced updates
- Point insertion functionality
- Individual line deletion

**Ready for Enhancement:** ✅ The current structure supports your planned features:
- **Grouping**: Can be added with collapsible sections
- **Bulk Delete**: Selection state management already exists
- **Drag & Drop**: Event structure supports this addition

### 3. Event System (`src/core/EventManager.js`) - ⭐ **Excellent Architecture**

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive event type definitions
- Proper memory leak prevention
- Event validation with schemas
- Performance optimizations (throttling, debouncing)
- Event delegation support

**Ready for Extension:** The event system is well-designed for adding new features.

### 4. Point Visualization System - ⭐ **Well Implemented**

**Current Features:**
- Click-to-add measurement points
- Persistent point display with labels
- Point deletion via sidebar
- World coordinate accuracy

**Enhancement Opportunities:**

## Specific Recommendations

### 1. Before Adding New Features
```javascript
// Fix the arc rendering issue first:
// In Canvas.js, debug this section:
_renderArcMove(move) {
  // Add extensive logging to isolate the problem:
  console.log('Arc params:', { 
    startX: move.startX, startY: move.startY,
    endX: move.endX, endY: move.endY,
    centerX: move.centerX, centerY: move.centerY,
    clockwise: move.clockwise 
  });
  
  // Test with known arc cases
}
```

### 2. For G-Code Drawer Enhancements
```javascript
// Current structure supports:
// - Add section headers with collapse/expand
// - Multi-select with checkbox UI
// - Drag handles with HTML5 drag API
// - Context menus for bulk operations
```

### 3. For Point Visualization
```javascript
// In Canvas.js, enhance markers:
// - Different shapes for start/end points  
// - Hover effects with coordinate display
// - Selection state indicators
```

## Code Quality Assessment
