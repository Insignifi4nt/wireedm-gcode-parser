# PR5: Canvas Cleanup

Status: Completed

## Summary
Remove duplicate/obsolete private methods from `Canvas.js` after delegation and ensure it acts as an orchestrator.

## Changes
- Delete moved methods; keep only public API and orchestration.
- Ensure imports for new modules present; removed unused imports.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build passes; public API stable; manual behavior parity confirmed.

## Verification
- Run through grid/path/marker/resize/DPI flows.
