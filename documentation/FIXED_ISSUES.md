## ✅ RECENTLY RESOLVED

### 13. **Sidebar Content Centering and Layout Issues** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 2025-01-17 21:30
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Sidebar content was cramped to the right side instead of being centered within the sidebar container
- **User Feedback**: "Elements inside the sidebar are crammed to the right side of the screen instead of centered"
- **Root Cause**: Outer sidebar container (`<aside id="sidebar-container">`) lacked proper centering styles for inner content
- **Technical Details**: 
  - HTML structure: `aside#sidebar-container` → `div.sidebar` → content sections
  - Container had no flexbox centering, causing inner div to stick to one side
  - Content used `justify-content: space-between` pushing elements to edges
- **Fix**: Added proper container centering and improved content layout
- **Files Modified**: `src/styles/main.css`, `src/styles/components.css`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Added `display: flex; justify-content: center` to `#sidebar-container`
  - Updated inner `.sidebar` to use full available width with proper max-width
  - Fixed responsive styles to target container instead of inner div
  - Improved content alignment within sections
- **Additional Improvements**: Enhanced visual design with better padding, shadows, and hover effects
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Sidebar content now properly centered with improved visual design

### 12. **Delete Point X Buttons Not Working** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 2025-01-17 21:00
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Individual point deletion buttons in sidebar were non-functional
- **Root Cause**: Issue resolved indirectly through foundational fixes to event system and canvas dimensions
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Delete button workflow was actually correct all along
  - Recent fixes to Canvas Dimension Consistency (#8) and Event Validation System (#10) stabilized the overall system
  - Event handlers were properly implemented: `handleDeleteButtonClick` → `POINT_DELETE` event → main.js filtering and re-indexing
- **Resolution**: Delete buttons now work correctly without explicit fixes
- **Files Modified**: No direct changes needed - resolved through system stabilization
- **Testing**: ✅ Delete buttons remove correct points, ✅ Remaining points reorder properly, ✅ No console errors
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Buttons now delete points and reorder correctly

### 11. **Coordinate Accuracy After G-Code Upload** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 2025-01-17 19:45
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Points appeared below cursor with consistent ~4mm offset after G-Code upload
- **User Feedback**: "Empty canvas coordinates work correctly, but after G-code upload there's a 4mm offset"
- **Root Cause**: Canvas transformation used `this.logicalHeight` while coordinate conversion used `viewport.displayHeight`
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Canvas transformation: `ctx.translate(offsetX, this.logicalHeight - offsetY)` 
  - Coordinate conversion: `CoordinateTransform.screenToWorld(..., this.displayHeight)`
  - Height mismatch created systematic coordinate offset after G-code loading
- **Fix**: Standardized both systems to use `viewport.displayHeight` as single source of truth
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/Canvas.js`, `src/main.js`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Line 335: Changed `this.logicalHeight` to `this.viewport.displayHeight` in canvas transformation
  - Lines 822-828: Added critical error detection for height mismatches
  - Line 259: Restored auto-fit functionality with corrected coordinate system
- **Testing**: ✅ Empty canvas coordinates accurate, ✅ Post G-code upload coordinates accurate, ✅ Auto-centering works
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Coordinate accuracy now consistent throughout workflow

### 10. **Event Validation System Improvements** - ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Timestamp**: 2025-01-17 17:30
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: EventManager validation errors spamming console on mouse and keyboard interactions
- **Root Cause**: EventManager validation was too strict for Event and KeyboardEvent types, failing `instanceof` checks for legitimate event objects
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Console errors: `EventManager: Invalid event data for mouse:enter:canvas: ["Field 'originalEvent' must be of type Event, got object"]`
  - Validation occurred on every mouse movement, enter, leave, and keyboard event
  - Events were working correctly but validation was causing console spam
- **Fix**: Enhanced Event and KeyboardEvent validation to accept both native instances and event-like objects
- **Files Modified**: `src/core/EventManager.js`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Lines 625-634: Modified Event validation to accept event-like objects with properties like `clientX`, `button`, `preventDefault`
  - Lines 635-644: Modified KeyboardEvent validation to accept keyboard event-like objects with properties like `key`, `code`
  - Maintained strict validation while being flexible for synthetic/wrapped events
- **Testing**: Mouse event validation warnings eliminated, keyboard events pass validation
- **Status**: ✅ Mouse events fixed, ⚠️ Minor `bounds` validation warnings remain (non-critical, on hold)

### 9. **Mouse Event Validation Errors** - ✅ RESOLVED (SUPERSEDED)
- **Timestamp**: 2025-01-17 16:45
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: EventManager validation errors spamming console on mouse interactions
- **Root Cause**: EventManager validation was too strict for mouse events, failing `instanceof Event` checks even for valid Event objects
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Console errors: `EventManager: Invalid event data for mouse:enter:canvas: ["Field 'originalEvent' must be of type Event, got object"]`
  - Validation occurred on every mouse movement, enter, and leave event
  - Mouse events were working correctly but validation was causing console spam
- **Fix**: Initially modified EventManager.emit() to skip validation for all mouse events (eventType.startsWith('mouse:'))
- **Files Modified**: `src/core/EventManager.js`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Line 311-318: Added conditional check to skip validation for mouse events
  - Preserved validation for all other event types
  - Clean, targeted solution without complex validation logic changes
- **Testing**: Console now clean during mouse interactions, all mouse functionality preserved
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED but approach superseded by better validation enhancement in #10

### 8. **Canvas Dimension Consistency** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 2025-01-17 15:30
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Canvas buffer mismatch errors causing coordinate accuracy problems
- **Root Cause**: `getBoundingClientRect()` returns fractional pixels (1373.2px) but `canvas.width` must be integer
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Console errors: `Canvas buffer mismatch: canvas=1373x1200, logical=1373.2000732421875x1200`
  - Fractional dimensions caused coordinate system inconsistencies
- **Fix**: Added `Math.round()` to all dimension calculations
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/Canvas.js`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Line 144-145: `Math.round(rect.width/height)` for logical dimensions
  - Line 153-154: `Math.round()` for High-DPI physical dimensions  
  - Line 805-815: Updated validation for both standard and High-DPI modes
- **Testing**: Eliminates console dimension errors, improves coordinate accuracy

### 7. **Click Coordinate Accuracy** - ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Timestamp**: 
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Points appear below cursor, with distance increasing toward top of screen
- **User Feedback**: "Points seem to go in center of cursor at bottom of screen, but higher up they move further down under cursor"
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent canvas height references between coordinate conversion and canvas transformation
- **Fix**: Standardized all height references to use `canvas.clientHeight` exclusively
- **Files Modified**: `src/core/Viewport.js`, `src/components/Canvas.js`, `src/core/MouseEventHandler.js`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Updated `Viewport.js` to use only `clientHeight` as authoritative height source
  - Fixed `Canvas.js` transformation to use `viewport.displayHeight` instead of `logicalHeight`
  - Updated `MouseEventHandler.js` to use `clientWidth/Height` for all coordinate operations
  - Enhanced coordinate debugging and validation system
- **Status**: Improved but issue persists after G-Code upload

### 6. **Mouse Wheel Zoom Behavior** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Wheel zoom centers on mouse position instead of screen center
- **User Request**: "I want zoom to be fixed in center of screen, not related to mouse position"
- **Fix**: Changed wheel zoom to use screen center coordinates instead of mouse position
- **Files Modified**: `src/core/MouseEventHandler.js`

## ✅ LEGACY RESOLVED ISSUES

### 5. **G Key Grid Toggle Not Working** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Pressing G key didn't toggle grid visibility
- **Root Cause**: KeyboardHandler was emitting GRID_SNAP_TOGGLE instead of GRID_VISIBILITY_TOGGLE
- **Fix**: Updated keyboard handler and added grid visibility toggle logic in main.js
- **Files Modified**: `src/core/KeyboardHandler.js`, `src/main.js`

### 4. **Export Points Button Not Working** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Export Points button was disabled and non-functional
- **Root Cause**: Missing export functionality implementation
- **Fix**: Implemented CSV export functionality with automatic file download
- **Files Modified**: `src/main.js`, `src/components/Toolbar.js`

### 3. **Clear Points Button Not Working** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Clear Points button was disabled and non-functional
- **Root Cause**: Toolbar component wasn't receiving point count updates to enable/disable buttons
- **Fix**: Implemented POINT_UPDATE event system to notify all components of point changes
- **Files Modified**: `src/main.js`, `src/components/Toolbar.js`

### 2. **Y-Axis Coordinate System Inconsistency** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Coordinate conversions between screen and world coordinates were inconsistent
- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between Canvas transformation and MathUtils coordinate conversion formulas
- **Fix**: Aligned coordinate conversion formulas with Canvas transformation logic
- **Files Modified**: `src/utils/MathUtils.js`

### 1. **Text Mirroring in Canvas** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Timestamp**: 
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: All text labels (grid labels, point markers) were appearing mirrored/upside down
- **Root Cause**: Canvas Y-axis flip transformation (`ctx.scale(zoom, -zoom)`) was affecting text rendering
- **Fix**: Created separate text-safe transformation (`_applyTextTransform()`) that renders text without Y-axis flip
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/Canvas.js`
