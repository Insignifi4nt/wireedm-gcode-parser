# CAD feature kinds

Every CAD feature kind is declared once, in `src/domain/cad/features/kinds/`, and registered in `cadFeatureRegistry.ts`. Consumers read
features through the definition rather than switching on kinds. What a kind shows people and agents is kept apart, in
`cadFeaturePresentation.ts`, so the kernel worker never loads its text. The definition owns:

| Declaration | Read by |
| --- | --- |
| `schema`, `fields` | The document schema (`cadFeatureSchemaUnion`), agent schemas and this page. |
| Slots (`cadFeatureReference`, `cadFeatureOptionalReference`) | Reference checks while parsing, and dependencies (`cadFeatureInputs`, `cadFeatureDependencies`). |
| Scalars (`cadFeatureScalarField`, `cadFeatureVectorField`) | Range checks while parsing, parameter traversals (`mapCadFeatureScalars`) and kernel limits (`cadFeatureScalar`). |
| `quantities` of a field holding nested values | What each number inside it measures, by path (`cadFeatureQuantityAt`). |
| `choices`, `condition` | Choice values in forms, and conditional fields such as a target that only exists for join and cut. |
| `outputs`, `body`, `occurrence`, `suppression` | Which features may feed a slot, which body a feature creates, keeps or consumes ([body identity](#body-identity)) and what an inactive feature leaves. |
| `evaluator` | Where the feature is evaluated and the version of that evaluation, for the rebuild cache. |
| `diagnostics` | Every code the kind's own checks and evaluation raise, apart from the steps all kinds share (`CAD_FEATURE_SHARED_DIAGNOSTICS`). |
| `check`, `instances` | Checks beyond the schema while parsing, and the solid count a feature makes. |

Its presentation, one entry per kind in `CAD_FEATURE_PRESENTATION`, owns:

| Declaration | Read by |
| --- | --- |
| `form` | The feature editor: a generic form from its controls, or the kind's own editor. |
| `agent` | Whether agent tools may name the kind, its description and its authoring schema. |

## Adding a kind

1. Add the stored type to the `CadFeature` union in `src/domain/cad/cadDocument.ts`.
2. Declare it in its family's module under `src/domain/cad/features/kinds/`. Build the shape with `cadFeatureShape` and the field helpers in
   `cadFeatureFields.ts`, and end the object with `satisfies CadFeatureDefinition<'your-kind'>`. Give every id-holding field a slot and
   every dimension a scalar; declare a field only when something reads it. A field holding nested numbers declares what each measures in
   `quantities`.
3. Register it in `catalog()` in `cadFeatureRegistry.ts`. The type check fails until every kind is registered with a matching shape. Add
   its schema to the end of `cadFeatureSchemaUnion`: the union order fixes the published document and edit schema hashes.
4. Evaluate it in the kernel (`src/features/cad/kernel/cadKernelModel.ts`), or in the domain for a reference kind.
5. Give it a form in `CAD_FEATURE_PRESENTATION` (`cadFeaturePresentation.ts`); the type check fails until every kind has an entry. A
   list of `controls` is drawn by the shared editor; a kind that needs more declares `editor: 'bespoke'` and adds its case to
   `CadFeatureEditor.tsx`.
6. Decide its agent exposure, in the same entry. Initial agent discovery must stay within 51,200 UTF-8 bytes (`cadAgentJourney.test.tsx`), so keep the
   description short. Update `docs/site/agents.md` if agents gain the kind.
7. List its `diagnostics`. `cadFeatureDiagnostics.test.ts` reads the kind's definition and its kernel case, follows the calls they
   make, and fails unless the list holds exactly the refusal codes found, less the shared ones. A code returned by a call is traced
   through the function's returns. The test also fails on a code it cannot trace to where it was written, and on a new site where it
   takes a caught error's code on trust, until that site is read and listed in the test. `cadFeatureQuantities.test.ts` fails until
   every number its schema accepts has exactly one declared quantity.
8. Regenerate the table below with `UPDATE_CAD_FEATURE_TABLE=1 npm test -- --run src/domain/cad/__tests__/cadFeatureTable.test.ts`.
   Without the variable the test fails while the table differs from the definitions.

Raise `evaluator.version` whenever the same stored feature would evaluate differently.

The kinds modules and the resolvers they call import each other, so none of them may read another while modules load: read schemas and
definitions inside functions, and build the catalog on first use. `cadFeatureModuleOrder.test.ts` loads each module of the cycle first and
fails if any of them does.

## Activity

Read whether a feature takes part in a rebuild with `cadFeatureActive(feature, scope)`. `npm run lint` refuses any other read of the stored
`suppressed` flag that names it: member and element access, destructuring by any literal key, including computed keys and destructuring
assignment, `'suppressed' in` and reflective reads. Code that means the stored value itself, such as the suppression toggle or a check
on an import result, reads it with `cadFeatureSuppressionFlag`. The check cannot see reads that never name the flag (key enumeration,
spreads, serialization) or keys built at run time; `scripts/check-feature-activity.ts` lists what it covers.

## Body identity

`src/domain/cad/cadBodies.ts` derives the bodies after each feature and keys each one by the feature that created it, so a body keeps one
key however often features change it. `createCadBodyLineage()` applies features in history order. Validation, the kernel, the workbench and
the export dialogs each derive the lineage of the history they show. The kernel adds what only geometry knows and returns the states with
every build (`CadBuildResult.bodies`, `CadMesh.bodyKey`). A kind's `body` behaviour decides the key:

| `body` | Key after the feature | What the feature's id leads to (`of`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | – | nothing |
| `new` | the feature's id, followed by the kind's `occurrence`: a mirror's is `flip/mirror` | the new body |
| `modify-target` | the key of its target or source | that body |
| `new-or-modify` | as `modify-target` when it names a target, otherwise as `new` | the body made or modified |
| `consume-tools` | the key of its target. Each tool body is consumed and records the feature as `consumedBy` | the target body |

- A body whose solids are told apart has `pieces`: one key for each solid, in `CadMesh.faceSolids` order. A body stays whole, with no
  pieces, until one of its solids may have split, or a pattern leaves a copy apart from the originals. A solid may have split when it leaves
  several solids, or when a solid of the result keeps none of the body's faces, since that solid might be a piece of any of them. A fused
  tool keeps the body whole. A body that has pieces keeps them, even when one solid is left. A new body starts whole, and so does a mirror
  image, whatever parts its source had.
- The kernel traces each solid of a feature's result to every source solid it keeps a face of unchanged (`createCadKernelFaceSources`):
  the solids of the target, of each pattern copy and of a fused tool. A key is inherited only when continuity is certain. Anything else
  gets a fresh key, a reported ambiguity or a reported loss, never a guess. Each solid of the result:
  - continues the one target piece it keeps faces of. A Boolean keeps its target's key, whatever tool or copies it absorbs;
  - keeping no target face, continues the one pattern copy it keeps faces of, keyed `inst(i,j)` after the piece copied, such as
    `box/inst(2,0)`. The copied piece itself becomes `inst(0,0)`, and nested patterns nest them. A solid of the fused tool alone gets a
    fresh key;
  - keeping faces of several target pieces, or of several copies and no target, merges them. It gets a fresh key, and the merged pieces are
    reported lost;
  - keeping no face at all, descends from the target's one key when the target has one key and the feature has no tool or copies.
    Otherwise it gets a fresh key. Face provenance is then incomplete: nothing proves that a piece one solid continues did not also split
    into it, or which piece no solid continues it is. So it, the pieces continued by one solid and the pieces no solid continues are
    ambiguous together.
- A key that one solid continues stays. When several solids continue it, each becomes `key/split(q)`, numbered by the first face of the
  body before that it keeps, never by position or size, then the solids that keep no face in the kernel's order. Fresh keys are
  `feature/split(k)`: solids of the tool, then merges, then solids that keep no face. Faces rank within their source in the order the
  kernel lists its solids, so ranks order solids only when the faces they are numbered by lie in the same solid of one source. Solids
  numbered by faces of different solids, as the several solids of a whole body are, or in the kernel's order, are marked `ambiguous` when
  there are two or more of them: the kernel might list them in another order for the same input. A piece no solid continues is lost, and
  references to it resolve as missing.
- Ambiguity is kept in groups (`CadBodyState.ambiguous`), and an ambiguous key resolves only to the pieces of its own group. The keys
  that descend from one group through one source form a group, so each pattern copy's pieces stay apart from every other copy's, until K5
  can establish identity. A group's earlier keys that no solid continues stay in it, as keys that can't be found, while a solid descends
  from the group through the target; once none does, they are lost.
- Each feature reports these in `CadBuildResult.bodyIssues` for D1 to adopt: `ambiguous-body-parts` for keys it makes ambiguous,
  `lost-body-parts` for pieces it removes or merges into another solid, and `untracked-body-parts` when a body gets more than
  `MAX_CAD_BODY_LIST` (4,096) parts. Its parts are then no longer tracked, and references to them resolve as missing. A key ambiguous only
  because it descends from an ambiguous key is added to the issue that reported that key, never reported again. A message gives counts,
  never keys; `pieces` lists the keys, at most 4,096. A build lists at most `MAX_CAD_BODY_ISSUES` (512) issues, and the last becomes
  `more-body-issues`, which counts the rest. Two cases are reported today: a fillet or chamfer of every edge rebuilds every face, so the
  pieces it changes keep none; and the kernel simplifies the result of a Boolean, which can merge faces, so a solid that continues a piece
  can keep none of its faces. Precise lineage through Booleans and splits waits for the kernel's own history (K3: modified, generated and
  deleted shapes).
- An inactive feature changes no body. Under `pass-through` its id leads to the body it would have changed, so selecting it selects that
  body; under `no-output` it leads nowhere. Validation and the kernel resolve a stored target strictly (`at`): it names the feature whose
  result the body now is, as before.
- Keys are derived on every rebuild and never stored, so the stored document is unchanged and targets still hold feature ids. S8's format
  cut stores targets as `CadBodyRef` (`{ kind: 'body', key }`, resolved by `resolveCadBodyRef` to a body, a part of one, a missing body
  with the feature that consumed it, or an ambiguous piece) and body metadata as `CadBodyMetadata` (`{ name, role, appearance?, material? }`)
  keyed by body key. Until then `resolveCadBodyMetadata` names each body after its creating feature, in the `part` role.
- Consumers choose a body by key. A selected feature leads to its body wherever it sits in that body's history (`cadSelectedBody`), and
  the latest body is chosen only when the selection leads to none. Worker requests and agent tools still pass the `featureId` of a body's
  current state as `bodyId`.

## Not yet slots

Revolve, circular pattern and mirror store their axis or plane as a choice of world axes and planes. K4 turns these into slots that
reference datum axes and planes. Pattern counts are scalars with `literal: true` until a format change lets them hold expressions.
