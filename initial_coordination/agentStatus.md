## Coordination Notes
- Phase 1 agents (A1, A2) should start immediately in parallel
- A3 can start once A2 completes tasks A2.1 and A2.2
- Phase 2 agents wait for their specific Phase 1 dependencies
- Phase 3 agents primarily need B3 (EventManager) completion
- Phase 4 is sequential - D1 and D2 can work parallel, D3 waits for all

## Agent Communication Requirements
- Each agent must log start/progress/completion in comm.md
- Update agentStatus.md when claiming tasks
- Mark dependencies resolved in completed.md
- Escalate conflicts immediately in comm.md

## Current Status Summary
- **Completed Agents**: A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, D3 (12/12 agents complete)
- **Ready Agents**: None (All agents complete)
- **Active Phase**: Phase 4 (Integration and Polish) - COMPLETE ✅
