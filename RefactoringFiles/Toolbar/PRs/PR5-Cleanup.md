# PR5: Toolbar Cleanup & Docs

Status: Completed

## Summary
Remove dead code from `Toolbar.js` after delegation; finalize docs with verification steps and commit references.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build passes; no console errors; public API stable.

## Test Plan
- Repeat toolbar flows; confirm parity and clean destroy behavior.

Implementation Notes
- Removed obsolete handler methods from `Toolbar.js` after delegation: file input/drag handlers, zoom/fit handlers, clear/export button handlers, zoom change subscription and display update method.
- Removed `VIEWPORT_ZOOM_CHANGE` unsubscribe from `destroy()` since ViewControls now owns the subscription.
- Ensured `destroy()` disposes FileControls, ViewControls, ActionControls and resets state.

Verification
- Manual smoke confirmed toolbar features unchanged; no console warnings; no duplicate listeners; destroy cleans up submodules.
