# PR0: Scaffold Toolbar Submodules

Status: Completed

## Summary
Add empty submodules with JSDoc stubs: `components/toolbar/FileControls.js`, `ViewControls.js`, `ActionControls.js`. No behavior changes.

## Motivation
Lay down clear module boundaries before migrating logic; minimize risk and diff size.

## Scope
- In: Create files with named exports and minimal methods (`init()`, `destroy()`), no external imports wired yet.
- Out: Toolbar refactor or DOM changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build passes; Toolbar continues to function without referencing new modules.

## Test Plan
- None (no functional change). Confirm files exist and import cleanly if referenced.

Implementation Notes
- Created `src/components/toolbar/{FileControls,ViewControls,ActionControls}.js` with minimal classes and stubs.
- Added `RefactoringFiles/Toolbar/00-scope.md` and PR docs (PR0â€“PR5).
- No imports used by Toolbar at this stage; behavior unchanged.
